Future addition will be to:

=>Define the lenght of the score. the fixed score is 100.
*Players will be able to set their score by themseleves.
e.g 25, 50, 100 etc

=>Hide the new game button when playing, then bring it back when game ends.

=>Make it an app
*make it an offline mobile app.

=>Looking to put the roll dice button on each pane under the current score card
rather than having one button in the middle.
*still not sure yet about this feature.
